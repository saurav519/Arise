## Quick overview

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Entry: `app/` directory (Next 13+ App Router)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.8+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

## Local development (Windows PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the project root and run:

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start development server
npm run dev
```

The dev server typically runs at http://localhost:3000.

## Build & production

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

(If `npm start` is not defined in `package.json`, use `npm run start` or a host-specific command; check `package.json` scripts.)

## Project structure (important files)

- `app/` â€“ Next.js App Router routes and pages
  - `layout.js` â€“ global layout (you are currently editing this file)
  - `page.js` â€“ main page
  - `globals.css` â€“ global styles
- `components/BrainstormTool.js` â€“ main Brainstorm UI component
- `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` â€“ configuration files
- `package.json` â€“ scripts and dependencies

## Developing

- Edit UI in `components/BrainstormTool.js` and pages in `app/`.
- Tailwind is already configured; update classes in JSX and `globals.css`.

## Notes & tips

- If you add environment variables (for example, an AI API key), add them to a `.env.local` file and do not commit that file.
- For TypeScript, you can add `tsconfig.json` and convert files to `.tsx`/`.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the dev server doesn't start, check Node version and run `npm install` again.
- If CSS is missing, ensure Tailwind is configured in `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`.

## License

This project has no license specified. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to make one explicit.

---

If you want, I can also:
- add a short `README` section describing the main component API,
- add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a minimal `LICENSE`, or
- update `package.json` scripts to include a `start` script for production.

Tell me which of those you'd like next.
